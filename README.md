Traditional merge sort algorithm:

Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by dividing it into two halves, sorting each half recursively, and then merging the two sorted halves back together. The divide and merge steps both take O(n) time, and the height of the recursion tree is O(log n), as the array is divided in half at each level. Therefore, the overall time complexity of mergesort is O(n log n).
